# Secrets Site

A website where you can make posts anonymously after creating your account and logging in.

# Home Page

This is the home page.If you are not logged in already, this screen will be shown and you can either register a new account or log in with an exsisting one. It uses cookies to determine whether you are logged in or not.

If you are logged in, you will directly be taken to the secrets page.

# Registration Page

This is where we can register a new account. We can also use our Gmail accounts for registration(Google OAuth API was used).

Since the site uses cookies, even if we close the tab and reopen it our session will still be authenticated. Also we are using Mongodb to store the credentials and secrets.

Note: The project is in the master branch.
